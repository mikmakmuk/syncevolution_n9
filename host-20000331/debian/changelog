host (20000331-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Oops, removed erroneous patch supposed to fix #104132 while it's

    tolerated. Thanks Mika Liljeberg. (closes: #153722)
  * Bumped Standards-Version to 3.5.6.1.

host (20000331-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Priority is in fact to remain extra, since bind9-host seems to be know
    highly preferred, with a standard priority.

host (20000331-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Orphan.  
  * I no longer use this, since I prefer bind9-host.  I see no evidence that
    this package is being maintained upstream, and the bug list is long.

host (20000331-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Update to latest upstream source, closes: #28042, #41255, #79422
  * add 'txt' to the set of zone-type links provided.  They all feel like
    namespace polution to me, but there is no conflicting usage in the Contents
    files, and users do seem to really like these.  Closes: #74958

host (19990701-1) unstable; urgency=low
